# This is my 1st post blog using Jekyll
## What is Jekyll?
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a simple static site generator which can convert *markup* files
into static *HTML* files.

## Why am I using it?
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is *powered by Jekyll*, so no need to setup anything locally.
Also, it is much easier to write content in **markdown** `*.MD` files, rather then in
*raw* **HTML* files.
