**Foundation Reflection: Discovering Human Skills**

Reflecting on the Foundation part of this course, I found that learning about Human Skills was both surprising and transformative. Coming into a tech Bootcamp, I expected to focus mainly on coding, problem-solving, and technical knowledge. I didn't anticipate that human skills like empathy, values, and self-awareness would play such an essential role in becoming a better developer. Yet, these skills have proven to be just as crucial as understanding JavaScript or HTML.

**What Surprised Me Most**

One of the most surprising aspects of the Human Skills module was how much it revealed about my own values and motivations. I realised that values like honesty and teamwork are foundational to the way I approach problems, both in tech and in life. Engaging with these topics in a group setting helped me see that others had different perspectives, and it made me more open to seeing how my own views fit into a broader picture.

**Learning Empathy and Self-Awareness**

Empathy was another key takeaway for me. In the tech world, we often think about empathy in terms of understanding our users or clients. But during this course, I found that empathy starts with understanding your peers and collaborators. It was challenging at times to step out of my own viewpoint and fully appreciate the struggles of others in the cohort, but doing so improved not just my teamwork, but also my ability to ask for help and offer genuine support.

Self-awareness was perhaps the hardest, yet most rewarding, skill to develop. By actively reflecting on my own habits, strengths, and weaknesses, I became more attuned to when I needed to take breaks, when I was pushing myself too hard, or when I needed to ask for help. I learned that being self-aware is crucial to managing stress and maintaining productivity over the long term.

**The Value of Human Skills in Tech**

Before starting this course, I wouldn't have thought of Human Skills as something that belongs in a tech Bootcamp. However, I now see how vital they are. Human Skills help us understand each other better, communicate more effectively, and work more cohesively in teams. They create an environment where everyone feels valued and heard, which leads to better collaboration and better end results.

It turns out that coding isn't just about writing great functions or solving algorithms. It’s about working effectively with others, understanding users, and managing one’s own emotions through the challenges that development brings. Learning to code is not just technical—it's also about becoming a better communicator and team player.

**Final Thoughts**

Studying Human Skills has been just as valuable as learning to code. It's helped me understand the importance of empathy, collaboration, and introspection in the tech industry. I feel more prepared now, not just as a developer, but as a teammate who can contribute positively to any work environment. I see now that the ability to grow as a human is just as important as growing as a developer.
