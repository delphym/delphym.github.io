# Problem Solving: A Journey through Challenges

Problem solving is a key part of being a developer. During my Foundation studies and in my previous career as a Java developer, I faced many situations where I had to stop, reassess, and overcome challenges that seemed simple but turned out to be surprisingly difficult. Here, I want to share two specific experiences—one where I got stuck and one where things went smoothly—along with the techniques that helped me.

## A Simple Roadblock

One issue that tripped me up for a while was a bug in a JavaScript function. I kept going through the logic multiple times but couldn't figure out why my calculations were incorrect. It turned out to be a simple off-by-one mistake when looping over two nested arrays. After spending a lot of time trying to solve it myself, I finally reached out for help.

I used a mix of techniques: pseudocoding, rubber ducking (explaining the problem out loud to myself), Googling, and asking for help from my peers on Slack. When I explained my logic out loud, I realised I had mismatched variable names in the arrays. That "aha!" moment felt humbling and a bit embarrassing, as I once again hadn't utilised the rubber ducking method properly and had to bother my peer with my problem.

## An Elegant Solution

There was another time when I managed to solve a problem easily and effectively. It was an assignment about manipulating the DOM, where we had to add new elements dynamically using JavaScript. I broke the task into smaller steps and wrote pseudocode for each action. Having a clear plan made everything go smoothly, and I was able to complete the task without any issues.

By visualising the final result and breaking down each step with pseudocode, I could anticipate problems before even writing the code. Completing the solution without any hiccups was incredibly motivating and reinforced the importance of planning ahead.

## Reflection on Problem-Solving Techniques

Throughout my journey, I found pseudocoding and rubber ducking to be extremely helpful tools. Pseudocoding helped me break down complex logic into manageable parts, while rubber ducking helped me see things more clearly. However, I struggle with doing rubber ducking by myself. I always find it more effective to explain my solution to a human peer, and I know I need to get better at using the rubber ducking technique on my own.

I've realised that I sometimes hesitate to ask for help because I grew up in an environment where it felt shameful to admit you didn't know something. In a professional setting here in New Zealand, I also noticed that asking for help too often was sometimes seen as a weakness. However, during this course, I learnt that asking for help not only speeds up problem solving but also builds a stronger community (though I wish this was always true in the workplace).

Moving forward, I want to be more proactive in reaching out for help when I need it and keep using problem-solving techniques consistently to develop a more structured approach to challenges. And if a human buddy isn't available, there's always an AI buddy to help 24/7!
