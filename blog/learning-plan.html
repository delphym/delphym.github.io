        <h1>Learning plan</h1>
        <p>
          My learning plan is aimed at improving my technical skills,
          productivity, and overall well-being. I will be working with a team of
          experts and advisors to help me learn and grow. Bellow, you could find
          my objectives and limitations. Further to that I have created
          <a href="./learning-plan-step-by-step.html"
            >A step by step guide to this Learning Plane</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
          I aim to establish myself as an independent IT expert, becoming a
          full-stack developer, software engineer, and DevOps specialist. This
          would enable me to work flexibly from any location and across
          different time zones.
        </p>

        <h2>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h2>
        <p>
          My strengths include strong problem-solving skills, adaptability, and
          resilience. I'm always willing to learn new skills and have excellent
          communication and teamwork abilities. I also possess good analytical
          skills and experience in Shell scripting, RDBMS, Java, and the Spring
          framework. Additionally, I have a strong work ethic and a commitment
          to continuous learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, my limitations include poor time management and
          organizational skills, which I am actively working on improving.
        </p>

        <h2>
          What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I would definitely like to improve my focus, time management, and
          ability to avoid distractions. Additionally, I believe I need to work
          on presenting ideas and information more confidently.
        </p>
        <h2>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
          This should include:
        </h2>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
            and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
            representatives
          </li>
          <li>
            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
            you
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I've committed to this program because I want to turn the challenging
          job market situation (struggling to find a job) into an opportunity to
          upskill and learn new things. I've also set some personal goals for
          myself, like learning front-end web development and improving my
          communication skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though I should dedicate at least 8 hours a day to study, I have
          significant responsibilities to my family and need to deal with our
          financial situation on daily basis, which takes away from my study
          time. On top of that, I need to drop my kids off at school every
          morning, so I'm available from 9:30 a.m. at the earliest. Sometimes, I
          also have to pick them up, meaning I'm unavailable between 2:45 and
          3:30 p.m.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key for me is to plan ahead based on my goals—daily, weekly, and
          long-term. I try to reflect on my progress and adjust my goals as
          needed, communicating this with my team and facilitator. Time
          management is crucial, as I often lose track of time or forget to take
          breaks. I try to stick to the timeboxing strategy and set alarms
          (using the Pomodoro technique).
        </p>
        <p>
          If things start to get overwhelming, I'd need to pause for a while,
          have thing about what's going on and what next steps should I take.
          Ultimately, I'll reach out to my facilitator and use the other
          available resources for help.
        </p>

        <h2>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h2>
        <p>
          As mentioned earlier, if I find that I need help (that is a hardest
          bit, to admit that.... similar to the situation of boiling frog), I
          will reach out to my cohort facilitator or any other available
          facilitator. I will also seek assistance from my cohort peers, either
          in person or through the available electronic communication channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned earlier, if I find that I need help (which can be the
          hardest part, like the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog"
            >“boiling frog”</a
          >
          syndrome), I will reach out to my cohort facilitator or any other
          available facilitator. I will also seek assistance from my cohort
          peers, either in person or through the available electronic
          communication channels.
        </p>

        <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
        <p>
          I hope the Facilitation team will support me through my challenging
          personal situation and help guide me away from negative thoughts that
          could hinder my learning, progress, and ability to meet deadlines. I
          expect them to steer me in the right direction on my learning journey
          and provide honest, constructive feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I expect them to maintain confidentiality and be
          committed to helping me develop my skills. They should foster a
          positive and supportive learning environment while offering guidance
          and support throughout the process. They will be there to listen,
          answer questions, and provide advice based on my strengths,
          weaknesses, and goals. I also expect them to help me identify
          potential roadblocks and offer resources to overcome them.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things.
        </h2>
        <p>
          For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs.
          It's important to plan these in.
